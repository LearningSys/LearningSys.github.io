	TensorFlow Overview and Future Directions <a href='slides/NIPS-Learning-Systems-Workshop-TensorFlow-Jeff-Dean.pdf' class='slides'>[Slides]</a>
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
Over the past few years, we have built two large-scale computer systems for training neural networks, and then applied these systems to a wide variety of problems that have traditionally been very difficult for computers.  We have made significant improvements in the state-of-the-art in many of these areas, and our software systems and algorithms have been used by dozens of different groups at Google to train state-of-the-art models for speech recognition, image recognition, various visual detection tasks, language modeling, language translation, and many other tasks.  Our second-generation system, TensorFlow, has been designed and implemented based on what we have learned from building and using DistBelief, our first generation system.  The TensorFlow API and an initial implementation was released as an open-source project in November, 2015 (see <a href='http://www.tensorflow.org/'>tensorflow.org</a>).  In this talk, I'll discuss the design and implementation of TensorFlow, and discuss some future directions for improving the system.

Intelligent Services: Serving Machine Learning <a href='slides/joseph_gonzalez_intelligent_services.pptx' class='slides'>[Slides]</a>
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
Machine learning has become the key component in building intelligent services and applications.  However, much of the focus in machine learning research and software systems is aimed at the design of increasingly sophisticated models, training algorithms, and large-scale systems for model training.  In this talk I will discuss the other and perhaps more important challenge machine learning systems: serving and maintaining trained models.  I will describe the machine learning life-cycle that spans beyond the fiction of training an isolated model on static data, to learning on changing data, competing models developed by multiple teams, and versioning.  I will characterize some of the unique challenges and opportunities of model serving in a low-latency and high-availability setting.  I will present mechanisms to enable models to compete and learn from feedback in real-time and discuss the opportunity to trade-off latency and accuracy.  I will present this work in the context of two systems, one being developed at UC Berkeley and another already in production at Dato Inc.

	Multiworld Testing: Contextual Bandits as a Service
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
There is a growing demand in today’s products and services to provide experiences that are highly personalized and relevant to the user’s situation at that moment.  However, optimizing models for contextual decisions can often be challenging and error-prone.  In this talk, I present the Multiworld Testing Decision Service, an Azure cloud service that we have designed and deployed to optimize contextual decisions as a service for applications. Based on cutting-edge contextual bandits research, our system can manage contextual decisions for applications in real-time using experimentation and online learning to rapidly respond to observed outcomes and optimize model performance.   We have deployed multiworld testing in several Microsoft products and services, for example, to make personalized news recommendations on the MSN homepage.  In our MSN deployment, the decision service is making hundreds of millions of recommendations per day and adapting the model to the most recent clicks every few minutes.  As a result, we have increased clicks on the optimized portions of the homepage more than 20% over the editorially managed version.  The Multiworld Testing Decision Service learning components are open-source, and the service is available for external use.

Functional Programming and Machine Learning: a natural fit
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
	<p>In the past decade, Functional Programming has evolved from a niche specialty into the mainstream. Modern programming languages such as F# or Scala have broadened adoption by demonstrating the practical benefits of functional techniques, and these ideas are progressively being incorporated into most traditional, well-established languages, such as C++ or Java.  </p>
	<p>In this talk, we will discuss specifically why Functional Programming and Machine Learning are a great fit. Using live coding in F#, on real-world examples, we will demonstrate how classic algorithms can be expressed very clearly - and correctly - in a functional style, and how functional idioms such as pipes-and-filters enable effective data exploration. Finally, we will show how functional programming lends itself naturally to parallelization, allowing for large-scale data processing.</p>

	Privacy in a Data-Driven World
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
The concept of personal privacy as a precious and fragile commodity worthy of protection has come under siege in today's data-driven world.  Users are eager to share their data online, and mobile applications and web services aggressively collect and monetize that information. This talk describes our vision for a new, privacy-preserving world; in it, users are more aware of the privacy implications of their online actions, and systems and applications are designed from the ground up with privacy in mind.  In support of this vision, we describe our research agenda to design, build, and evaluate new transparency tools that increase users' and privacy watchdogs' visibility into how personal data is being used by applications, and programming abstractions and tools that facilitate the construction of privacy-mindful applications.  We provide two examples of such tools and abstractions.  First, we describe Sunlight, a new web transparency tool that helps privacy watchdogs track how web services use individuals' personal data to target ads, personalize content, or adjust prices. Second, we describe FairTest, a new testing toolkit that helps programmers test for unfair or discriminatory effects within their data-driven applications.  Overall, our tools and abstractions aim to increase privacy by promoting a more responsible, fair, and accountable approach to user data management.

</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
In this talk I will give an overview over three simple techniques to accelerate algorithms for recommendation (matrix factorization, factorization machines), estimation of probabilities (logistic regression), sampling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and for deep architectures. The talk will focus on the guiding principles (cache locality, power laws, prefetching, lock-free computation, asynchrony) to achieve very high performance on single machines and in the cloud.

	A Selection Hardware Trends for Machine learning Systems
</div>
<div class='talk-abstract'>
Modern (beefy) servers with TBs of memory and tens of cores are ubiquitous and (relatively) inexpensive; they are even readily available from cloud providers. These systems have sufficient powers that they may obviate the need of scale out architectures for all but the largest problems. Inside those beefy machines, a few different hardware trends have taken shape: multiple cores, non-uniform memory access, and single instruction multiple data parallelism (SIMD). In some cases, these trends are doubling the throughput in each generation of processor. But there is a catch. One's algorithm must be able to take advantage of incredibly fine grained parallelism and instruction reordering. Using SGD as a case study, this talk describes three of our engines that take advantage of these trends. We describe how this changes both the analysis and how one implements these approaches. Some of these ideas have found their way into use at web companies for deep learning systems and into other analytics frameworks including our own DeepDive framework.

<p>Everything discussed in this talk is in open source, see <a href="http://deepdive.stanford.edu/">http://deepdive.stanford.edu/</a> and our github.</p>
